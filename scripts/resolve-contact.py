"""resolve-contact.py — resolve a contact alias to phone/email.

Reads all AddressBook source databases under
  ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/
including iCloud/Exchange/CardDAV source subdirs, NOT just the top-level
abcddb (which on this Mac holds only the local "me" record). Returns the
best-match identifier (phone or email) on stdout, or empty if no match.

Match order:
  1. Direct identifier (phone/email shape) → return as-is.
  2. Exact case-insensitive substring against "first last nickname org" → use it.
  3. Fuzzy match (difflib SequenceMatcher) against name tokens, with a
     similarity cutoff. Handles typos like "gailene" → "Gaileen".

Usage: resolve-contact.py "gailene"
Exit codes: 0 always (no match prints empty line).
